# Decentralized Data DAO

## Overview
This project aims to create a decentralized data DAO on the blockchain, leveraging smart contracts and web technologies to enable a trustless and transparent data governance model. The platform facilitates the creation, storage, and management of decentralized datasets through a community-driven approach.

## Features
- **Smart Contracts for Data Governance:** Utilizes blockchain smart contracts to enforce transparent and decentralized governance of datasets within the DAO.
- **Decentralized Storage:** Implements distributed and secure storage solutions to store datasets, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.
- **Community-driven Decision Making:** Empowers community members to propose, vote, and govern dataset-related decisions using DAO mechanisms.
- **Full-Stack Development:** Incorporates both frontend and backend components, providing a seamless user experience for interacting with the decentralized data DAO.

## Technologies Used
- **Blockchain:** Utilizes [Blockchain] for smart contract deployment and execution.
- **Smart Contracts:** Developed using [Solidity], ensuring robust and secure execution of governance rules.
- **Frontend:** Built with [NextJS], providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for community members.
- **Backend:** Implements [Hardhat] to manage data storage, retrieval, and communication with the blockchain.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [[repository URL](https://github.com/abubakar508/Data-DAO-fullstack.git]`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` (for both frontend and backend)
3. Configure blockchain connection details in the frontend and backend configurations.
4. Deploy smart contracts to the blockchain.
5. Run the frontend and backend servers.
